# BP_signal-processing
signals selection:\
download_data.m: a script to download the signals that meet our requirements\
detect_NaN.m: detect the percentage of NaN values in each signal (PPG, ECG and ABP)\
detect_flat.m: detect the percentage of flat lines in each signal (PPG, ECG and ABP)\

features extraction\
check_detector.m: plot out PPG and ECG signals every 5 minutes\
main.m\
normalize_signal.m: min_max normalization\
filter_signal.m: a 4th-order Butterworth bandpass filter\
BP_annotate.m: annotate PPGâ€™s characteristic points (foot, systolic peak, dicrotic notch, and diastolic peak)\
detect_rpeak.m: annotate r peak of ECG signals\
generate_features.m: a function to generate all the required features\
