check_detector.m: plot out PPG and ECG signals every 5 minutes
detect_NaN.m: detect the percentage of NaN values in each signal (PPG, ECG and ABP)
detect_flat.m: detect the percentage of flat lines in each signal (PPG, ECG and ABP)
detect_rpeak.m: annotate r peak of ECG signals
filter_signal.m: a 4th-order Butterworth bandpass filter
